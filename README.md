# Taxi demand predictor service

## Summary
Use case: we are working for a NYC Taxi company, and we would like to optimize the number of cars available at any time. This means having low number of cars available at low-demand hours, and many more at peak hours. As a simple exercise, we would like to make a prediction on the demand of rides at any hour.
